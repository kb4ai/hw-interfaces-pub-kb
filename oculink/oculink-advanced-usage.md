# OCuLink Advanced Usage Patterns

## Beyond eGPUs: Expanding OCuLink Applications

### High-Speed Networking
OCuLink's 128 Gbps bandwidth enables **100+ Gbps networking** cards:
- Connect enterprise-grade network adapters
- Achieve datacenter-level networking on desktop/SBC
- No bottlenecks from protocol conversion

### PCIe Switching and Multiplexing
Use PCIe switches to share OCuLink bandwidth:
- Multiplex 128 Gbps across multiple devices
- Create flexible expansion configurations
- Enable hot-swappable device arrays

### Storage Arrays
OCuLink excels for high-performance storage:
- Direct-attached NVMe arrays
- No protocol overhead for maximum IOPS
- Ideal for video editing, databases, AI workloads

## Cable Considerations

### Cost Factor
- OCuLink cables "are not the cheapest"
- But "not too expensive" either
- Quality varies significantly between vendors
- Length limitations due to signal integrity

### Cable Types
- Passive cables: Shorter distances, lower cost
- Active cables: Longer runs, higher cost
- Shielding quality affects stability

## Practical Implementation Tips

1. **Power Planning**: External devices need separate power
2. **Signal Integrity**: Keep cables as short as practical
3. **Thermal Management**: High-bandwidth devices generate heat
4. **Compatibility Testing**: Not all PCIe devices work perfectly

## Future Possibilities

With SBCs like Radxa O6 offering:
- OCuLink (128 Gbps)
- M.2 slots (64 Gbps + 32 Gbps)
- Total: 224 Gbps of PCIe bandwidth

This enables workstation-class expansion on compact platforms.
